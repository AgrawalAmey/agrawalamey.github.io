Backpropagation is one the fundamental algorithms in deep learning. In this blog post, I am trying to explore backpropagation the way my [IIT-JEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Entrance_Examination_%E2%80%93_Advanced) maths teacher would do. First, we would list few basics results then derive some handy rules and finally analyze some common graphs. I strongly recommend reading Christopher Olah's  [blog](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/) if you are unfamiliar with backpropagation.
