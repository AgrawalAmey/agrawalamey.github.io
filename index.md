# Amey Agrawal

I am an engineer with the systems group at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/). I am currently working on low-level systems for Azureâ€™s globally distributed AI infrastructure service under the supervision of [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/muthian/](Dr. Muthian Sivathanu). Prior to that, I spent a couple of years working at [Qubole](https://www.qubole.com/), a big data platform start-up, where I built several components of the Apache Spark-based data science platform and worked on applications of machine learning for software engineering problems. I am applying for Ph.D. programs this Fall with focus on ML for systems and systems for ML.
