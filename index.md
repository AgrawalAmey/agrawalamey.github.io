# Amey Agrawal

 I am a member of technical staff at [Qubole](https://qubole.com). I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Birla Institute of Technology & Science](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2018. My research includes machine learning for systems, natural language processing and reinforcement learning. *I am looking for machine learning engineer roles.*
