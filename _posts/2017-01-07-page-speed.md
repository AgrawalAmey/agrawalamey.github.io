College fests are irreplaceable delights of an engineering college student's life. Each college tries to make it's fests bigger yet different than others and so is case with fest websites. These fest websites stand as expression of creativity of it's makers which more often than not this leads to large page load time and poor user experience. While working on websites for <a target='_blank' href="http://bits-oasis.org/2015main/"> Oasis </a> and <a target='_blank' href="http://bits-apogee.org/2016/"> Apogee </a> at Department of Visual Media following are few techniques we explored to make our websites faster. Both graphics designers and front-end developers might find the blog helpful.

### 1. Choose the right file format
This is the most basic yet the most effective step of all. With improved browser rendering engines SVG files have gained popularity in the web design domain, being vectors they scale up with screen sizes without any depreciation in quality and they are lightweight as a bonus they support animations and JavaScript interactions.

But sometimes designs contain textures which cannot be recreated in vectors in such situation which one is better JPEG or PNG? This question does not have a generic answer. JPEG uses lossy data compression unlike PNG and hence is always smaller in size. But the lossy compression has it's own implications, if your image contains text you better not be using JPEG. PNG also supports use of transparency which makes its use as necessity at times.

Just choosing the right file format can save up to 80% payload in images.

### 2. Select the right export settings

Many designers tend to ignore this part which can actually be very crucial while exporting to raster formats (JPEG and PNG). Typically in printing CMYK colors are used which are 32 bit colors and hence many design tools use CMYK colors by default while exporting but web only supports 24 bit RGB colors (though a browser would display a CMYK image it cannot reproduce the exact colors). Apart from this JPEG also supports 8 bit grayscale colors. Progressive and Optimized JPEGs can also provide significant reduction in size. As a rule of thumb you might use baseline optimized JPEGs but I strongly suggest going through <a target='_blank' href="https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiDpYncjLDRAhXFOo8KHVvLBs8QFggZMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fforums.adobe.com%2Fthread%2F1962929&usg=AFQjCNGcfh77OnWkOA99LnDRVfTQ7G0GWQ&sig2=5wkjdUoFPIhqeqCC66PFQg"> [1] </a> and <a target='_blank' href="http://superuser.com/questions/379404/what-is-the-difference-between-progressive-and-optimized-jpegs-in-photostop"> [2] </a>.

PNG provides with four color modes of which 24 bit RGB and 8 bit paletted are of interest to us. Typically you will be using RGB colors but if the image does not contain too many colors 8 bit paletted colors could be a great boon. It would choose only the 256 colors most relevant to the image and hence decrease the size of image drastically. As a word of caution using paletted color modes can sometimes even increase the size of image when the dimensions of image are small.

<a target='_blank' href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/creativesuite/cs/using/WSC7A1F924-DD38-49b4-B84B-EFF50416C860.html"> [3] </a> is a great read about the teaks discussed above.

### 3. Compress your files

Though file compression is the most obvious step in decreasing page load time it is still not performed right most of the times. For all your text files HTML, Js, CSS, JSON, etc. minify (whitespace removal) is the only major compression technique available. Though it might appear to be elementary it's aggregate impact could be significant. Most modern text editors like sublime text and atom have plugins for minification. You can also add this to your gulp/grunt build process.  

Different image formats have different compression techniques and there exist great open source utilities like <a target='_blank' href="http://www.kokkonen.net/tjko/projects.html"> JPEGOptim </a> , <a target='_blank' href="http://www.advsys.net/ken/util/pngout.htm"> PNGOUT </a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/svg/svgol"> SVGO </a> which can decrease the file size by up to 70%. I personally prefer <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/toy/image_optim"> image_optim </a> which combines all these packages and provides handy shell interface which works for all image formats and integrates easily into build processes. But setting up image_optim on windows could be too tricky, if you are on windows you might want to install those utilities individually or you could also use <a target='_blank' href="https://tinypng.com/"> TinyPNG </a> for rasters and <a target='_blank' href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/"> SVGOMG </a> for SVGs.

Some compression techniques in the above mentioned utilities are lossy hence deal with them cautiously.

### 4. Use gzip compression

Browsers can decode gzip encoded files from server. gzip does not help much with raster images but compresses text files to about one tenth. Now this is a massive saving with minimum efforts, gzip compression can be easily enabled on both apache and nginx. <a target='_blank' href="https://varvy.com/pagespeed/enable-compression.html"> [4] </a> is a handy guide for the same.

Fun fact: SVG files are just XML documents and gzip works great on those. The complete isometric map of the miniature city on the landing page of Apogee 2016 website mentioned earlier is a single ginormous SVG file of about 2 MBs. SVGO compression decreased it to half and ultimately with gzip it is transfered as a payload of only about 200 KBs.

### 5. Avoid loading multiple fonts

Fonts make websites beautiful but they can make websites load too slowly. Google fonts is by and far the best option to load fonts on web, almost all the fonts (or their similar alternatives) are available on google fonts. As browsers cache fonts many a times the google fonts you are trying to load might already be in userâ€™s cache. Also many a times we only need one or two font-weights for a given font which we can choose to load selectively in google fonts which can dramatically reduce the size.

If you need a font only for some titles, it might be a good idea to export those as SVGs instead. Though a bit tedious this is a big saving also it removes barrier to your creative ideas.

### 5. Lazy load files

Loading all the content at once might make the loading times large specially in one page sites. Lazy loading files of less importance might turn out to be useful, <a target='_blank' href="http://sourcey.com/recliner/"> Recliner.js </a> is a great tool to achieve the same.

### 6. Decrease the number of requests

Decreasing number of HTTP requests can make your page load significantly faster. <a target='_blank' href="https://www.giftofspeed.com/fewer-http-requests/"> [5] </a> describes different ways you can achieve the same. Apart from the ones described above SVG sprites are useful in decreasing number of requests. <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/jkphl/svg-sprite"> svg-sprite </a> is a useful tool for making SVG sprites.

HTTP/2 would completely change this landscape though, you can read more about it in <a target='_blank' href="https://blog.newrelic.com/2016/02/09/http2-best-practices-web-performance/"> [6]</a>.

### 7. Enable caching
Caching the less frequently changed files makes pages load super-fast for returning users. <a target='_blank' href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/how-to-optimize-your-site-with-http-caching/"> [7]</a> walks through enabling caching in apache, for nginx you might want to refer <a target='_blank' href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-caching-guide/"> [8]</a>.

I hope that this posts helps in making you sites faster. If you have any suggestions please write them down in the comments bellow. Thank you!
