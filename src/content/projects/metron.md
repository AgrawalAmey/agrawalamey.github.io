## Abstract

The rapid development of LLM inference systems has created a need for comprehensive performance evaluation frameworks. Existing benchmarks often focus on isolated metrics, failing to capture the complex interplay between different performance dimensions. Metron provides a holistic evaluation framework that assesses LLM inference systems across multiple dimensions including latency, throughput, and resource utilization under realistic workloads.

## Key Features

- **Holistic Evaluation**: Measures multiple performance dimensions simultaneously
- **Realistic Workloads**: Includes real-world request patterns and distributions
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new systems and metrics
- **Open Source**: Fully available for community use and contributions

## Community Impact

Metron has become a standard benchmarking tool in the LLM serving community, with over 50 research papers using it for evaluation and numerous industry teams adopting it for performance testing.
