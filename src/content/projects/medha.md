## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for tasks that require processing extremely long contexts, sometimes spanning millions of tokens. However, efficiently serving such long-context requests poses significant challenges in terms of memory management and computational efficiency. Medha addresses these challenges by introducing novel techniques for serving multi-million token context LLM inference requests without resorting to approximations that compromise accuracy.

## Key Contributions

- Novel memory management techniques for handling extremely long contexts
- Efficient scheduling algorithms optimized for long-context scenarios
- System design that maintains accuracy while improving efficiency
- Comprehensive evaluation on real-world long-context workloads

## Technical Innovation

Medha introduces a hierarchical memory management system that efficiently handles the quadratic memory requirements of attention mechanisms in transformers when dealing with million-token contexts. Our approach achieves up to 3x better memory efficiency compared to existing systems while maintaining full accuracy.
